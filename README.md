# The M5 Competition

</center>

This is one of the M5 Competition hosted by Kaggle. The objective of the M5 forecasting competition is to advance the theory and practice of forecasting by identifying the method(s) that provide the most accurate point forecasts for each of the 42,840 time series of the competition. I addition, to elicit information to estimate the uncertainty distribution of the realized values of these series as precisely as possible. \
To that end, the participants of M5 are asked to provide 28 days ahead point forecasts (PFs) for all the series of the competition, as well as the corresponding median and 50%, 67%, 95%, and 99% prediction intervals (PIs).

Now, as a budding practitioner in this field, I am instead going to use their dataset purely for learning; the goal here is not to compete, even though I might make a submission if I have reasonable results. To practise my machine learning forecasting, I'll be building traditional statistical models then use them as benchmarks for more sophisticated machine learning models. I'm not sure as yet, what methods I'll be using as I haven't explored the data. It'll be an iterative process moving forward.
